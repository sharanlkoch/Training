#PACKAGES
'''Python packages help in modularizing the code while ensuring code reusability. 
Common in-built Python packages include pip and setuptools.
Classes, functions, modules, etc., can be imported from other modules using the import keyword. 
The' as' keyword refers to a module by another name.'''

#LIBRARIES
'''Python libraries are a collection of related modules that contain bundles of codes
that can be used in different programs. Making use of Python libraries makes it convenient for 
the programmer as they wouldn't have to write the same code multiple times for different programs.'''
